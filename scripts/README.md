### 2. Add Token to Environment

Add your API token to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Add this line to your .env.local file
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### 3. Run the Seeding Script

```bash
# Seed content (skips if content already exists)
npm run seed

# Force seed content (overwrites existing content)

```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: "No API token provided"

- Make sure you've added `SANITY_API_TOKEN` to your `.env.local` file
- Restart your development server after adding the token

### Error: "Insufficient permissions"

- Make sure your API token has "Editor" permissions
- Check that the token is for the correct project

### Error: "Content already exists"

- This is normal! The script skips existing content to prevent duplicates
- Use `npm run seed:force` to overwrite existing content

### Content not showing on homepage

- Make sure your development server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check that your Sanity project ID and dataset are correct in `.env.local`
- Verify the content was created in Sanity Studio
